Data Sheet

Dataset Summary:
The dataset comprises three distinct audio files, with each representing a specific genre of music: Lofi, 
piano, and rap. The Lofi audio file is a 3-hour and 19-minute long compilation. The piano audio file is 
2 hours long. The rap audio file is 52 minutes long. Each audio file has been sampled at 8,000 samples 
per second, capturing amplitude information at each time point. The dataset aims to provide a diverse 
range of audio samples for training models to generate Lofi-style music.

Data Collection:
Convert each audio file from its original format to an MP3 file.
Resample each audio file to 8,000 samples per second.

Dataset Usage:
This dataset can be used for training deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs), to generate Lofi-style music. By leveraging the diverse range of audio samples available, models
can be trained to learn and reproduce the characteristic sound and style of Lofi music. Additionally, 
the dataset can be used to investigate the impact of different music genres on model performance and the 
quality of the generated audio.

Limitations:
The dataset consists of a relatively small number of audio files, which may limit the diversity of audio 
samples and the model's ability to generalize well. The quality of the audio files might vary, as they are 
sourced from different YouTube videos. This variation in quality may introduce additional noise into the dataset.
The dataset only includes three distinct music genres, which may not be sufficient for capturing the full 
spectrum of musical styles and influences present in Lofi music.
